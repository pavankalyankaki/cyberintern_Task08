**Working with VPNs**

**What is a VPN?**
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a remote server, masking your real IP address and routing your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Privacy Protection**: Hides your real IP address and location
- **Data Encryption**: Protects your data from interception on public networks
- **Secure Communication**: Ensures safe browsing and data transmission
- **Bypass Restrictions**: Access geo-blocked content and websites

**How VPNs Work:**
1. Install VPN client software
2. Connect to a VPN server of your choice
3. Your traffic gets encrypted and routed through the VPN server
4. Websites see the VPN server's IP instead of yours

**Common VPN Protocols:**
- OpenVPN
- WireGuard
- IKEv2/IPSec
- L2TP/IPSec

**Limitations:**
- Can slow down internet speed due to encryption overhead
- Cannot guarantee complete anonymity
- Dependence on VPN provider's privacy policies
- Some websites may block VPN traffic
- Free VPNs often have data limits and fewer server options

**VPN vs Proxy:**
While both hide your IP address, VPNs encrypt all your traffic and work system-wide, whereas proxies typically only work for specific applications and don't encrypt data.

VPNs are essential tools for maintaining online privacy and security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks or accessing sensitive information.
